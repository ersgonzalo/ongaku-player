Building this project during my Personal Hackathon time at Fullstack Academy. At the moment, is a website that will play some various local music. At the moment...functional enough. At the end, it will hopefully replicate foobar2000 functionality!

To Dos:
------------
- Refactor all the ugly(Directives, Factories, etc)
- Drag Files in to add Songs
- Get Tag Data from Files
- Allow Editing of Tags
- FLAC Support
- Playlists
- Last.fm scrobbling
- Build it as a Chrome App
- Build as a Firefox Extension?
- Save & Export Library Configuration
- Draggable Elements?

Possibly to Use:
------------
- [audio-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audio-metadata)
- [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
