Building this project during my Personal Hackathon time at Fullstack Academy. At the moment, is a website that will play some various local music. At the moment...not functional at all. At the end, it will try to replicate foobar2000 functionality!

To Dos:
------------
- Drag Files in to add Songs
- Playlists
- Build it as a Chrome App
- Build as a Firefox Extension?
- Save & Export Library Configuration
