Building this project during my Personal Hackathon time at Fullstack Academy. At the moment, is a website that will play some various local music. At the moment...not functional at all. At the end, it will try to replicate foobar2000 functionality!

To Dos:
------------
- Drag Files in to add Songs
- Playlists
- Build it as a Chrome App
- Build as a Firefox Extension?
- Save & Export Library Configuration

Possibly to Use:
------------
- [audio-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audio-metadata)
- [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
- [MusicMetaData](https://github.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata)
- [Flac.js and Aurora](http://audiocogs.org/articles/2012/06/15/flac-and-aurora/)

Special thanks to:
