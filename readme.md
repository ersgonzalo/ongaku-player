Building this project during my Personal Hackathon time at Fullstack Academy. Is a webapp(?) that will play various local music from your own computer. At the moment...somewhat functional! Built on HTML, CSS, Javascript(lots of Angular.js). At the end, it will hopefully replicate foobar2000 functionality!

To Dos:
------------
- Refactor all the ugly(Directives, Factories, etc)
- Drag Files in to add Songs
- Playlists
- Get Tag Data from Files
- Allow Editing of Tags
- FLAC Support
- Last.fm scrobbling
- Build it as a Chrome App
- Build as a Firefox Extension?
- Save & Export Library Configuration
- Draggable Elements?
- Read from Dropbox/Google Drive?

Possibly to Use:
------------
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [audio-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/audio-metadata)
- [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
- [MusicMetaData](https://github.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata)
- [Flac.js and Aurora](http://audiocogs.org/articles/2012/06/15/flac-and-aurora/)
